When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful if mulitple people are working on a project. The local version is only 
available to you, but a remote version that is accessible to others invites collaboration. With a remote
repository, you can also release tested, production-ready versions to the public, while keeping the versions
still under development local.
