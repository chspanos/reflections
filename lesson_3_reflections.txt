When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful if multiple people are working on a project. The local version is only 
available to you, but a remote version that is accessible to others invites collaboration. With a remote
repository, you can also release tested, production-ready versions to the public, while keeping the versions
still under development local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on a version of the code locally, while someone else is also working on it separately. 
If they checked in their code, you would not want an automatic pull, especially if you were in the middle 
of another change. By always pulling the changes manually, you can control the update.
